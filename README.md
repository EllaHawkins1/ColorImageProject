Step 1: Back-End Setup
Create a Virtual Environment
Before installing dependencies, set up a virtual environment :

Copy code
python -m venv venv
in the terminal to Activate the Virtual Environment


Install Required Packages
Install all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Back-End
Start the back-end by running the app.py file:


Run the file within VS code 
python app.py
This will launch the server that powers the AI colorization process.

Step 2: Front-End Setup
Open the Project in Visual Studio Code
Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed. Open the project directory in VS Code.

Install Live Server Extension
To run the front-end locally, install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code:

Go to the Extensions panel (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+X ).
Search for Live Server and click Install.


Step 2: Run the Front-End

Locate the index.html file in the project directory.
Right-click on index.html and select Open with Live Server.
Alternatively, click Go Live in the bottom-right corner of VS Code.
A browser window will open, displaying the app's interface.
